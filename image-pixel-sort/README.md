## DERANGE AN IMAGE:

*******************************

    Takes in an image and...
    - Applies BFS to find areas of similiar luminance.
    - For each row in this area sorts the pixels by luminance.
    
    Initially, a second attempt at common algorithms (quick sort).
    But I ditched this to try an optimise the process.

    2_mp4.py naively runs the other script and produces a short mp4 clip of the progressive derrangement.
